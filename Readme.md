A snake game with two player capability.

### Instructions
The classic game is remade in a two player fashion. Who can level-up their snake while competing for the same rare candy while avoiding the other snake?

#### Choose a game mode
You can play the game with a friend locally or you can choose to play against the fearsome AI!

##### Human vs Human
Use the L, U, D, R arrows to control the red snake and the W, A, S, D keys to control the blue snake.

May the best snake win!
